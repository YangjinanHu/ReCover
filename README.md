# ReCover
This is a project created by Sandra Pan, Priyam Patel and Alex Yangjinan Hu in the IvyHacks Competition. 

## Inspiration
Although we have lived with Covid-19 for nearly a year, people are still not getting used to wear facemasks properly and regularly. Some people refuse to wear one, or even blame those who ask them to wear one. We want to change the status quo and make a safer community for our world. 

## What it does
ReCover aims to cultivate the habit of wearing masks properly. It is a non-profit educational app which combines professional instructions and entertainment experience. Registered users can use this app to check the latest news of Covid-19, learn the knowledge about prevention, report local merchants not wearing masks during open time, design customized masks and donate masks to underprivileged groups etc. By doing the right things and good causes, users will receive ReCover virtual points and redeem them for donation, mask DIY tool bags, local merchants coupon or other rewards.

## How I built it
We brainstormed in the first meeting and ...TO BE FINISHED

## Challenges I ran into
One of our members withdraw from the team on Saturday. He is the only one who have experience and skillsets in app development. The rest of us either have no tech background or are not familiar with app development. Also, this is the first Hackathon for three of us. 

Besides, we locate at different places and thus we have to deal with huge time-difference everyday. It was common to work alone and checked with each other at a time when everyone were not sleep. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Three of us degined the mechanism and main interface of ReCover within two days. When the single coder quited from our team, we were concerned about the deliverables and whether we could finish this project. However, we didn't give up. We learned Frigma online and other skills on our own quickly. 

## What I learned
As for the hardskill, we learned how to use Frigma and how to build prototype. Regaridng the softskills, we learned how to work in a cross-cultural team and how to navigate in ambiguous situation.

## What's next for ReCover
Instead of finishing the interface design, we'd like to develop the app for ReCover and promote it to the market.
